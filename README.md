Craft Demo Project using AngularJS - By Josh Schoen, front-end developer and designer

[CRAFT DEMO:](http://joshschoen.com/craft)

Using the native AngularJS data binding features we can easily assign conditional classes and styles and other design attributes. This data can then be captured and sent to the server for setup and processing. Potentially this information could also be transformed into a Photoshop script to recreate the intended design, which could then be sent to production.

This example is a quick demo of how the front-end customer facing interaction could be created, it is not intended to be a fully functional demo rather a starting place for further development.

This has been tested on Desktop browsers Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
